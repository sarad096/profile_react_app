<p className="aboutdesc">Iâ€™ve been passionate about webdevelopment since I was a kid. My parents had a grocery story and I wanted to expand it to the online level when I was in high school and they admitted me to IT institution to be an active developer in the web designing. I knew then that I wanted to pursue web design as my career. I studied Web Design via online courses and documentations available on internet and also graduated from Butwal Multiple Campus 4 years ago.</p>
